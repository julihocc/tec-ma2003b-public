4.5 Oblique Rotation Method

Contents
- When to use oblique vs orthogonal rotation
- Direct Oblimin rotation method
- Promax rotation algorithm
- Pattern matrix vs structure matrix interpretation
- Factor correlations and their implications

Learning Goals
- Decide between orthogonal and oblique rotation approaches
- Implement oblique rotation algorithms
- Distinguish between pattern and structure matrices
- Interpret factor correlations meaningfully
- Understand trade-offs between simplicity and realistic modeling

Practice Activities
- Apply both Direct Oblimin and Promax rotations
- Compare oblique and orthogonal solutions on same data
- Interpret pattern vs structure matrices
- Analyze factor correlations and their practical significance

Notes
- Oblique rotation allows factors to be correlated
- Pattern matrix shows unique relationships between variables and factors
- Structure matrix shows total relationships including correlations
- Factor correlations should be interpreted in context of theoretical expectations
- Oblique solutions are often more realistic but harder to interpret

4.3 Choosing the Appropriate Number of Factors

Contents
- Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues > 1)
- Scree plot analysis and elbow method
- Parallel analysis for factor retention
- Goodness-of-fit measures and model comparison
- Cross-validation and holdout approaches

Learning Goals
- Apply multiple criteria for determining factor number
- Interpret scree plots and identify optimal cut-points
- Implement parallel analysis procedure
- Evaluate model fit for different factor solutions
- Make informed decisions about factor retention

Practice Activities
- Create and interpret scree plots
- Implement parallel analysis from scratch
- Compare factor solutions with different numbers of factors
- Use goodness-of-fit statistics to guide decisions

Notes
- No single method is definitive for choosing number of factors
- Combining multiple approaches increases confidence in decisions
- Theoretical considerations should complement statistical criteria
- Over-extraction is generally preferred to under-extraction in exploratory analysis

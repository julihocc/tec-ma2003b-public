4.1 Objectives of Factor Analysis

Contents
- Understand the primary objectives of factor analysis in multivariate data analysis
- Distinguish between factor analysis and principal component analysis approaches
- Identify latent variable structures in real-world applications
- Compare exploratory vs confirmatory factor analysis methodologies
- Apply factor analysis to psychological, business, and research contexts

Learning Goals
- Explain the fundamental objectives: dimensionality reduction, latent variable identification, and data structure understanding
- Describe how factor analysis models measurement error and common variance
- Compare factor analysis and PCA in terms of purpose, interpretation, and application
- Recognize when factor analysis is more appropriate than other multivariate techniques
- Apply factor analysis concepts to practical research scenarios

Practice Activities
- Generate synthetic data with known factor structure to validate methodology
- Perform correlation analysis to identify potential factor patterns
- Compare factor analysis and PCA results on the same dataset
- Interpret factor loadings and communalities in practical contexts
- Demonstrate factor analysis applications across multiple domains

Key Concepts
- Latent Variables: Unobserved constructs that influence multiple observed variables
- Factor Loadings: Correlations between observed variables and underlying factors
- Communalities: Proportion of variable variance explained by all factors
- Common vs Unique Variance: Shared variance explained by factors vs variable-specific variance
- Factor Model: X = ΛF + ε (observed = loadings × factors + error)

Applications Demonstrated
- Psychology: Intelligence and personality factor identification
- Marketing: Customer segmentation and brand positioning
- Finance: Risk factor analysis and portfolio modeling  
- Education: Academic ability assessment and curriculum evaluation

Comparison with PCA
- Factor Analysis: Theory-driven, focuses on explaining correlations, models latent constructs
- PCA: Data-driven, maximizes variance explained, creates linear combinations
- FA better for: Theory testing, measurement model validation, latent variable research
- PCA better for: Data compression, dimensionality reduction, exploratory data analysis

Implementation Notes
- Python implementation includes factor_analyzer library with fallback methods
- Julia version provides clear pseudocode for educational understanding
- LaTeX presentation covers theoretical foundations and practical applications
- All implementations demonstrate FA vs PCA comparison with synthetic data

Prerequisites
- Understanding of correlation and covariance matrices
- Basic knowledge of eigenvalue decomposition
- Familiarity with multivariate normal distributions
- Concepts of variance and explained variance

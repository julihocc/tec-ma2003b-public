4.1 Objectives of Factor Analysis

Contents
- Understand the main purposes of factor analysis in multivariate statistics
- Compare and contrast factor analysis with principal component analysis
- Identify appropriate applications across different domains
- Recognize exploratory vs confirmatory approaches

Learning Goals
- Explain when factor analysis is preferred over other dimensionality reduction techniques
- Describe the concept of latent variables and their relationship to observed variables
- Apply factor analysis objectives to real-world data scenarios

Practice Activities
- Analyze a dataset to determine if factor analysis is appropriate
- Compare factor analysis and PCA results on the same data
- Interpret factor loadings in context of research objectives

Notes
- Factor analysis assumes that correlations among variables are due to underlying latent factors
- The method is particularly useful when theoretical constructs cannot be directly measured
- Applications span psychology, marketing, social sciences, and many other fields

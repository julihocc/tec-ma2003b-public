# Chapter 1 — Regression Analysis

This chapter covers fundamental and advanced regression analysis techniques for modeling relationships between variables in multivariate data.

## Chapter Overview

Regression Analysis is a statistical method for modeling and analyzing the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This chapter progresses from simple linear regression to advanced techniques including variable selection methods and diagnostic procedures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Perform simple and multiple linear regression analysis
- Conduct ANOVA for regression models and construct confidence intervals
- Analyze residuals and test for normality assumptions
- Apply forward and backward selection for variable selection
- Handle aberrant data and heteroskedasticity issues
- Implement non-linear regression techniques

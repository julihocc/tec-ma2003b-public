# 5.4 Stepwise Selection

This folder contains materials for Topic 5.4: Stepwise variable selection methods in discriminant analysis.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply stepwise selection to discriminant analysis
- Use forward, backward, and bidirectional selection methods
- Apply statistical criteria for variable inclusion/exclusion
- Balance model complexity with interpretability
- Validate variable selection using cross-validation

## Key Concepts

- **Forward Selection**: Start with no variables, add one at a time
- **Backward Elimination**: Start with all variables, remove one at a time
- **Bidirectional Selection**: Combines forward and backward approaches
- **Wilks' Lambda**: Multivariate test statistic for group differences
- **F-to-Enter/Remove**: Statistical criteria for variable selection

## Usage

```bash
cd python/
python stepwise_selection_practice.py
```

# 5.5 Canonical Discriminant Functions

This folder contains materials for Topic 5.5: Canonical discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction and interpretation.

## Learning Objectives

- Compute canonical discriminant functions
- Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for discrimination
- Interpret canonical variates and their coefficients
- Reduce dimensionality while preserving group separation
- Visualize group separation in canonical space

## Key Concepts

- **Within-group Covariance (W)**: Pooled covariance matrix
- **Between-group Covariance (B)**: Matrix of group mean differences  
- **Canonical Variates**: Linear combinations maximizing group separation
- **Generalized Eigenvalue Problem**: W⁻¹B eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- **Canonical Correlation**: Measure of group separation along each axis

## Usage

```bash
cd python/
python canonical_practice.py
```

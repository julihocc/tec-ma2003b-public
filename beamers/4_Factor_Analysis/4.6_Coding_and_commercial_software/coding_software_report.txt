4.6 Coding and Commercial Software

Contents
- Python implementation using scikit-learn and factor_analyzer
- R packages: psych, GPArotation, lavaan for factor analysis
- SPSS factor analysis procedures and output interpretation
- SAS PROC FACTOR capabilities and options
- Practical considerations and software limitations

Learning Goals
- Implement factor analysis in multiple programming environments
- Choose appropriate software tools for different analysis goals
- Interpret output from commercial statistical packages
- Understand software-specific options and defaults
- Troubleshoot common implementation issues

Practice Activities
- Perform same analysis across different software platforms
- Compare results and identify software-specific differences
- Create custom implementations for specialized needs
- Validate software results against manual calculations

Notes
- Different software may use different default settings
- Some packages excel at exploratory while others focus on confirmatory analysis
- Custom implementations provide deeper understanding of algorithms
- Commercial software offers user-friendly interfaces but less flexibility
- Always verify results across multiple implementations when possible

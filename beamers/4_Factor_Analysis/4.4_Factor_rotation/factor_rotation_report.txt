4.4 Factor Rotation

Contents
- Need for factor rotation and simple structure
- Orthogonal rotation methods (Varimax, Quartimax, Equimax)
- Varimax rotation for maximum variance of loadings
- Comparison of different orthogonal rotation criteria
- Interpretation of rotated factor solutions

Learning Goals
- Explain why factor rotation improves interpretability
- Implement Varimax rotation algorithm
- Compare results from different rotation methods
- Interpret rotated factor patterns
- Understand the concept of simple structure

Practice Activities
- Apply Varimax rotation to unrotated factor solution
- Compare interpretability before and after rotation
- Implement rotation algorithms from mathematical formulations
- Visualize factor patterns in loading space

Notes
- Rotation preserves the total variance explained by factors
- Varimax maximizes the variance of squared loadings within factors
- Simple structure aims for high loadings on few variables per factor
- Rotation is an iterative process that converges to optimal solution

# Chapter 5 ‚Äî Discriminant Analysis

This chapter covers discriminant analysis techniques for classification and pattern recognition in multivariate data.

## Chapter Overview

Discriminant Analysis is a statistical technique used to classify observations into predefined groups or categories based on their characteristics. This chapter progresses from basic two-population discrimination to advanced techniques including canonical discriminant analysis and practical software implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Perform linear and quadratic discriminant analysis for classification
- Understand the role of prior probabilities and misclassification costs
- Apply basic discrimination techniques with performance evaluation
- Use stepwise selection for variable selection in discriminant analysis
- Compute canonical discriminant functions for dimensionality reduction
- Implement discriminant analysis using various software tools

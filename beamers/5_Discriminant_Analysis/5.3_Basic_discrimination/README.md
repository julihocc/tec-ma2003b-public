# 5.3 Basic Discrimination

This folder contains materials for Topic 5.3: Basic discrimination techniques and performance evaluation metrics.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement basic discriminant analysis algorithms
- Evaluate classification performance using various metrics
- Create and interpret confusion matrices
- Calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures
- Apply cross-validation for model assessment

## Key Concepts

- **Confusion Matrix**: Cross-tabulation of actual vs predicted classifications
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate (correct classification of group 1)
- **Specificity**: True negative rate (correct classification of group 2)
- **Overall Accuracy**: Proportion of correct classifications
- **Cross-validation**: Model assessment using holdout samples

## Usage

```bash
cd python/
python basic_discrimination_practice.py
```

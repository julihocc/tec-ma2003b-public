## Course Intention

This intermediate mathematics course focuses on analyzing multidimensional large databases. Students identify characteristics of problems that can be addressed using multivariate statistical techniques.

**Required prior knowledge:**

- Probability and statistics
- Probability functions
- Normal distribution
- Inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals)

---

## Learning Outcome

Students will analyze a multidimensional phenomenon or process using one or more multivariate statistical techniques learned in the course.

---

## Course Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:

- Build structured, analyzable databases.
- Extract relevant information using statistical methods and tools.
- Formulate mathematical models for large-scale optimization.
- Analyze systems with an integrated vision.
- Solve real-world problems ethically and responsibly.

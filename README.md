# MA2003B - Application of Multivariate Methods in Data Science

This repository contains materials and resources for the course **MA2003B - Application of Multivariate Methods in Data Science**. The course is part of the Mathematics discipline at the School of Engineering and Sciences.

## Course Overview

MA2003B is an intermediate mathematics course focused on the analysis of multidimensional large databases. Students will learn to identify and solve problems using multivariate statistical techniques, with prior knowledge required in probability, statistics, and inferential methods.

### Learning Outcome

Students will analyze multidimensional phenomena or processes, applying one or more multivariate statistical techniques learned in the course.

## Course Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:

- Build structured, analyzable information-based databases within an organization.
- Extract relevant information from large structured databases using statistical methods and technological tools.
- Formulate mathematical models commonly used in large-scale optimization.
- Analyze interconnected systems with an integrated vision for problem-solving.
- Solve real-world problems with ethical awareness, responsibility, and fairness.

## Course Topics

1. **Regression Analysis**
   - Simple and multiple linear regression
   - ANOVA, confidence intervals, residual analysis
   - Model selection (forward, backward)
   - Non-linear regression
   - Aberrant data and heteroskedasticity

2. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Multivariate distributions, mean vectors, covariance matrices
   - Correlation matrices, multivariate normal distribution
   - Handling missing or incorrect values
   - Multivariate descriptive analytics and visualization

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Use cases, geometric interpretation, estimation, and selection of components

4. **Factor Analysis**
   - Objectives, equations, factor rotation (including oblique), and selection

5. **Discriminant Analysis**
   - Discrimination for two normal populations, cost functions, stepwise selection, canonical functions

6. **Cluster Analysis**
   - Similarity/dissimilarity measures, graphical methods, non-hierarchical and hierarchical grouping, nearest neighbor

7. **Multivariate Regression**
   - Logistic regression, inference for variances/covariances, MANOVA, canonical correlation, factor analysis in regression

## Methodologies

- **Supervised Learning:** Teacher-led modules, discussions, mentoring, and counseling.
- **Independent Learning:** Research, exercises, case studies, and field work focused on data acquisition, storage, transformation, and decision-making.

## Evaluation

- **50%**: Participation, assignments, cases, and module exams (theoretical and practical knowledge).
- **50%**: Performance in the challenge process and outcomes, demonstrating mastery of competencies.

Course intention within the general study plan context:
This intermediate mathematics course focuses on the analysis of multidimensional large databases. In the process, students
identify the characteristics of different problems that can be addressed using multivariate analysis statistical techniques. Prior
knowledge is required of  probability and statistics, probability functions, normal distribution, and concepts related to inferential
statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Learning outcome: Students analyze a multidimensional phenomenon or
process, in which they will apply one or more of the multivariate statistical techniques learned in the course.

Course objective:
Upon completion of this educational unit, students will be able to:
- Build structured, analyzable information-based databases based in an organization.
- Extract relevant information from large structured databases using statistical methods and appropriate technological tools.
- Formulate the mathematical models most frequently used in large-scale optimization processes.
- Analyze the world as a set of interconnected systems being aware of the need to include an integrated vision in understanding
and solving field-related issues.
- Solve problems from diverse environments of life, with ethical awareness, responsibility, and fairness.

Course intention within the general study plan context:
This intermediate mathematics course focuses on the analysis of multidimensional large databases. In the process, students
identify the characteristics of different problems that can be addressed using multivariate analysis statistical techniques. Prior
knowledge is required of  probability and statistics, probability functions, normal distribution, and concepts related to inferential
statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Learning outcome: Students analyze a multidimensional phenomenon or
process, in which they will apply one or more of the multivariate statistical techniques learned in the course.

Course objective:
Upon completion of this educational unit, students will be able to:
- Build structured, analyzable information-based databases based in an organization.
- Extract relevant information from large structured databases using statistical methods and appropriate technological tools.
- Formulate the mathematical models most frequently used in large-scale optimization processes.
- Analyze the world as a set of interconnected systems being aware of the need to include an integrated vision in understanding
and solving field-related issues.

- Solve problems from diverse environments of life, with ethical awareness, responsibility, and fairness.

Specific learning objectives by topic:

Suggested methodologies and learning techniques:
Learning activities led by an academic (Supervised Learning):
1. Review and conceptual analysis conducted by the teacher through learning modules in which they address issues related to
multivariate statistical modeling from data.
2. Discussions and resolution of situations related to the challenge faced in the segment.
3. Mentoring and supervision of the field work carried out by the student when facing the challenge in a real environment.
4. Individual and group counseling sessions aimed at supporting the challenge resolution process.
Independent learning activities (Individual Learning):
1. Individual and team research on the fundamentals of regression analysis and multivariate statistical methods.
2. Solution of exercises, problems and cases, both individually and collaboratively, to develop the ability to carry out multivariate
statistical analysis procedures to classify, group or model from a series of data.
3. Field work in the context of the real environment in which it faces the challenge related to the appropriate management that
goes from the acquisition, storage and transformation of data focused on decision making.
4. Generation of evidence of the development of skills associated with the challenge. Deliverable: a complete report of the solution
to the real problem together with the justification of the appropriate statistical method that was chosen.

Teaching and learning tecniques:
Not Specified

Estimated timing per topic:

Suggested evaluation policies:
Student learning will be evaluated through procedures and criteria to assess the outcome of the learning process in students’
performance in the modules, and through performance or product evidence to observe the development of competencies. The
evaluation procedures and respective weighted criteria are as follows:
50% --- Participation in and results of activities, assignments, cases and learning module exams, evaluating theoretical and
practical knowledge related to the use of regression models and multivariate analysis for data science.
50% --- Performance in the challenge process and outcomes, considering evidence that shows the level of mastery in the following
competencies.

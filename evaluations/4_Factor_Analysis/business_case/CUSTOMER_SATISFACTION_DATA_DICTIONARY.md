## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Data
- **Pattern**: Approximately 5% missing data rate across satisfaction items
- **Mechanism**: Missing completely at random (MCAR)
- **Handling**: Students should assess pattern and choose appropriate imputation method

### Scale Properties
- **Satisfaction Items**: Ordinal scales treated as interval for Factor Analysis
- **Distribution**: Approximately normal distribution centered around scale midpoint (4)
- **Range**: All satisfaction items use full 1-7 scale range

### Correlation Structure
- **Expected Factors**: 5 underlying dimensions based on theoretical framework
- **Inter-factor Correlations**: Moderate to high correlations between factors (0.45-0.72)
- **Factor Loadings**: Range from 0.4-0.9 depending on theoretical strength

## Analytical Considerations

### Factor Analysis Suitability
- **Sample Size**: N=3,400 exceeds minimum requirements (>300, >10 per variable)
- **Variable Ratio**: 23 satisfaction items provide adequate complexity
- **Correlation Matrix**: Expected to show sufficient correlations for factor extraction

### Recommended Analyses
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examine distributions, correlations, missing patterns
2. **Factorability Assessment**: Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, Bartlett's sphericity test
3. **Factor Extraction**: Compare Principal Components vs. Maximum Likelihood methods
4. **Factor Rotation**: Test Varimax (orthogonal) vs. Promax (oblique) rotations
5. **Validation**: Cross-validation with outcome variables

### Business Context Variables
- **Industry**: Technology consulting services (high-touch, relationship-driven)
- **Client Type**: Enterprise clients (complex needs, long-term relationships)
- **Service Model**: Project-based consulting with ongoing support components
- **Market Dynamics**: Competitive industry with high client retention importance

## File Format
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Delimiter**: Comma (,)
- **Missing Values**: Represented as empty cells (pandas default)
- **Header**: First row contains variable names
- **Index**: No row index included (use customer_id + quarter as composite key)

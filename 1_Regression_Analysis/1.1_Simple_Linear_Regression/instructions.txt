Instructions for students:
1. Review the Python script (simple_linear_regression_practice.py) to understand how linear regression is implemented.
2. Run the Python script. This will:
   a. Generate a file named 'report.txt' containing the regression model's intercept, slope, R-squared value, and a salary prediction example.
   b. Display a plot showing the data points and the regression line.
3. Open and observe the output in the generated file: 'report.txt'.
4. Interpret the meaning of the slope (b1) from the report: For each additional year of experience, what is the estimated increase in salary?
5. Interpret the meaning of the R-squared value from the report: What percentage of the variation in salary is explained by experience?
6. Observe the generated plot displaying the data points and the regression line.
7. Examine the predicted salary for a new experience value in the 'report.txt' file.
8. (Optional) Modify the X and Y data within simple_linear_regression_practice.py with your own examples, re-run the script, and see how the results in 'report.txt' and the plot change.

# Factor Analysis Presentation - Authenticity Report

## Summary
All numerical results in the Factor Analysis presentation are now based on authentic code execution. The presentation contains real results from working Python scripts that implement both PCA and Factor Analysis.

## Authentic Results Verified

### Example 1: Educational Assessment (Synthetic Data)
- **PCA Script**: `educational_pca.py` ✅ 
- **FA Script**: `educational_fa.py` ✅
- **Results**: Real eigenvalues, loadings, and variance explained

### Example 2: European Stock Market Returns  
- **PCA Script**: `invest_pca.py` ✅
- **FA Script**: `invest_fa.py` ✅
- **Results**: Real financial data analysis with authentic statistical outputs

### Example 3: Kuiper Belt Object Properties
- **PCA Script**: `kuiper_pca.py` ✅ 
- **FA Script**: `kuiper_fa.py` ✅
- **Results**: Real astronomical data analysis with verified results

### Example 4: Hospital Health Outcomes
- **PCA Script**: `hospitals_pca.py` ✅
- **FA Script**: `hospitals_fa.py` ✅ **[NEWLY CREATED]**
- **Results**: Authentic healthcare quality analysis results

## Key Authentic Results Now in Presentation

### Hospital Health Outcomes Factor Analysis
- **Factor Structure**: 1 factor extracted (eigenvalue = 5.637)
- **Variance Explained**: 70.5% of total variance
- **Factor Loadings**: 
  - PatientSatisfaction: 0.954 (highest loading)
  - NurseRatio: 0.905
  - SurgicalComplications: -0.896
  - MortalityRate: -0.838
  - ReadmissionRate: -0.836
- **Model Quality**: KMO = 0.909 (Excellent), Bartlett's test significant
- **Communalities**: Most variables show high common variance (h² > 0.6)

## Transparency Achieved
- All results in the presentation can be reproduced by running the corresponding scripts
- No estimated or fabricated numerical values remain in the presentation
- Students can verify results by executing the code themselves
- Complete transparency supports educational integrity

## Technical Implementation
- Created `hospitals_fa.py` with comprehensive Factor Analysis implementation
- Script includes assumption testing (KMO, Bartlett's), factor retention analysis, and interpretation
- Results automatically saved with visualization (`hospitals_fa_loadings.png`)
- Integrated with existing logging system for educational traceability

## Educational Impact
- Students see real statistical outputs rather than illustrative examples
- Authentic results demonstrate practical application of FA methods
- Real data supports deeper understanding of method limitations and strengths
- Reproducible results enable hands-on learning and verification

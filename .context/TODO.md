# TODO - MA2003B Factor Analysis Project

## Immediate Tasks

### Code Quality & Standards
- [ ] Fix lint warnings in `hospitals_fa.py` (unnecessary f-strings, zip strict parameter)
- [ ] Standardize print statements across all FA scripts for consistency
- [ ] Add type hints to function signatures in analysis scripts
- [ ] Review and standardize variable naming conventions

### Documentation & Educational Materials
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all FA analysis functions
- [ ] Create unified README for each example directory explaining the educational objectives
- [ ] Add data dictionary explanations for each dataset used
- [ ] Document the pedagogical progression from PCA → FA → comparison

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add unit tests for core FA analysis functions
- [ ] Create integration tests that verify script outputs match presentation values
- [ ] Add data validation checks in fetch scripts
- [ ] Implement regression tests to catch changes in numerical results

### Presentation Enhancements
- [ ] Add slide transitions and animations for better flow
- [ ] Include more visual comparisons between PCA and FA results
- [ ] Add interpretation guidelines for different eigenvalue patterns
- [ ] Create summary slides with key takeaways for each example

## Future Improvements

### Advanced Statistical Features
- [ ] Implement confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) examples
- [ ] Add oblique rotation options (promax, oblimin) for comparison
- [ ] Include factor score computation and interpretation
- [ ] Add goodness-of-fit measures for factor models

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] Convert static plots to interactive visualizations
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebook versions of all examples
- [ ] Add parameter exploration widgets for educational demos
- [ ] Implement live code execution in presentation slides

### Additional Examples
- [ ] Add psychological measurement example (Big Five personality)
- [ ] Include customer satisfaction survey analysis
- [ ] Create social science research example
- [ ] Add time series factor analysis example

### Technical Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up automated CI/CD pipeline for presentation building
- [ ] Add Docker container for reproducible environment
- [ ] Implement automatic figure generation and embedding
- [ ] Create script to update all presentation figures at once

## Completed ✅

### Authenticity & Transparency
- [x] Created missing `hospitals_fa.py` script
- [x] Updated presentation with authentic FA results from real code execution
- [x] Verified all 4 examples have working PCA and FA scripts
- [x] Replaced estimated values with actual statistical outputs
- [x] Created authenticity report documenting real vs estimated results

### Repository Organization
- [x] Restructured Factor Analysis presentation with new pedagogical approach
- [x] Organized code examples into clear directory structure
- [x] Cleaned up repository structure and removed outdated files
- [x] Implemented consistent logging across all analysis scripts

### Core Functionality
- [x] Implemented comprehensive Factor Analysis for hospital health outcomes
- [x] Added proper data preprocessing and assumption testing
- [x] Generated factor loadings visualizations
- [x] Created factor interpretation and validation sections

## Notes

### Educational Philosophy
- Maintain transparency between code and presentation
- Ensure all numerical results are reproducible
- Provide clear progression from theory to practice
- Support hands-on learning with working examples

### Code Standards
- Use the project's logger utility consistently
- Follow py-percent cell format for VS Code compatibility
- Save outputs (figures, reports) adjacent to scripts
- Include educational markdown cells explaining concepts

### Presentation Standards
- Use authentic results from actual code execution
- Provide clear interpretation of statistical outputs
- Include both PCA and FA perspectives for comparison
- Maintain Tec de Monterrey branding and style

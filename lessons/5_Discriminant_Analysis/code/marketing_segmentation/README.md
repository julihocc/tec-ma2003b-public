# Marketing Segmentation Discriminant Analysis

This example demonstrates discriminant analysis for customer segmentation in marketing analytics. The analysis classifies customers into three segments (High-Value, Loyal, Occasional) based on their behavioral metrics.

## Business Context

A retail company wants to segment their customer base to optimize marketing strategies and resource allocation. By understanding distinct customer behaviors, the company can:

- **High-Value Customers**: Focus on retention and premium services
- **Loyal Customers**: Encourage upselling and cross-selling opportunities
- **Occasional Customers**: Implement re-engagement campaigns

## Dataset Description

The synthetic dataset contains 1,200 customers with 8 behavioral metrics:

- **purchase_freq**: Average purchases per month
- **avg_order_value**: Average dollar amount per order
- **browsing_time**: Average session time in minutes
- **cart_abandonment**: Rate of abandoned shopping carts
- **email_open_rate**: Percentage of marketing emails opened
- **loyalty_points**: Accumulated loyalty program points
- **support_tickets**: Average support interactions per month
- **social_engagement**: Social media interactions per month

## Analysis Approach

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

- Assumes equal covariance matrices across groups
- Finds linear combinations that maximize between-group separation
- Provides interpretable discriminant functions

### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

- Allows different covariance matrices for each group
- More flexible but requires more parameters
- Better for groups with different variability patterns

## Key Results

### Discriminant Function Interpretation

**First Discriminant Function (LD1)**: Primarily separates High-Value from Occasional customers

- High positive loadings: avg_order_value, loyalty_points, social_engagement
- High negative loadings: cart_abandonment, support_tickets
- Interpretation: Overall customer value and engagement level

**Second Discriminant Function (LD2)**: Distinguishes Loyal from other segments

- High positive loadings: purchase_freq, email_open_rate
- High negative loadings: browsing_time (negative relationship)
- Interpretation: Purchase frequency vs. browsing behavior

### Classification Performance

- **LDA Accuracy**: ~92% on test set
- **QDA Accuracy**: ~94% on test set
- Both methods show strong performance with QDA slightly better
- Cross-validation confirms stable performance across folds

### Business Insights

1. **High-Value Segment**: Characterized by high spending, frequent purchases, and strong engagement
2. **Loyal Segment**: Regular purchasers with moderate spending but high email engagement
3. **Occasional Segment**: Infrequent buyers with higher cart abandonment and support needs

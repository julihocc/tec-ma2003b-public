  - Needs improvement: >5.0%

### `NurseRatio` (float)
- **Description**: Nurse-to-patient ratio
- **Units**: Nurses per patient
- **Range**: 0.20-0.50 (1 nurse per 2-5 patients)
- **Clinical significance**: Higher ratios associated with better patient outcomes and safety
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Excellent: >0.40 (1:2.5 ratio)
  - Good: 0.35-0.40 (1:3 ratio)
  - Average: 0.25-0.35 (1:4 ratio)
  - Inadequate: <0.25 (1:5+ ratio)
- **Note**: Based on registered nurses in direct patient care roles

### `SurgicalComplications` (float)
- **Description**: Surgical complication rate
- **Units**: Percentage (%)
- **Range**: 0.8-5.5% (complications per 100 surgical procedures)
- **Types included**: Postoperative infections, bleeding, organ injury, unexpected returns to OR
- **Clinical significance**: Lower values indicate better surgical quality and safety
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Excellent: <2.0%
  - Good: 2.0-3.5%
  - Average: 3.5-4.5%
  - Needs improvement: >4.5%

### `EDWaitTime` (float)
- **Description**: Emergency department average wait time
- **Units**: Minutes
- **Range**: 15.0-90.0 minutes (door-to-provider time)
- **Clinical significance**: Shorter times indicate better ED efficiency and patient satisfaction
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Excellent: <30 minutes
  - Good: 30-45 minutes
  - Average: 45-60 minutes
  - Needs improvement: >60 minutes
- **Note**: Time from arrival to initial provider assessment

## Correlation Structure

The synthetic data exhibits realistic correlations found in hospital quality studies:

1. **Strong general quality factor (~70% of variance)**:
   - High-quality hospitals perform well across multiple metrics
   - "Halo effect": Good management affects all aspects of care
   - Organizational culture and resources impact all outcomes

2. **Key correlations observed**:
   - **MortalityRate vs ReadmissionRate** (positive): Poor outcomes cluster together
   - **PatientSatisfaction vs NurseRatio** (positive): Staffing affects patient experience
   - **InfectionRate vs SurgicalComplications** (positive): Both reflect safety culture
   - **EDWaitTime vs other metrics** (negative): Efficiency relates to overall quality

## Hospital Quality Dimensions

### Clinical Effectiveness (PC1 ~70%)
- **Primary indicators**: MortalityRate, ReadmissionRate, SurgicalComplications, InfectionRate
- **Interpretation**: Overall clinical quality and patient safety
- **Drivers**: Medical staff competency, evidence-based protocols, quality improvement programs

### Patient Experience & Efficiency (PC2 ~8-10%)
- **Primary indicators**: PatientSatisfaction, EDWaitTime, AvgLengthStay
- **Interpretation**: Service quality and operational efficiency
- **Drivers**: Staff communication, facility design, process optimization

### Resource Utilization (PC3 ~5-8%)
- **Primary indicators**: NurseRatio, AvgLengthStay
- **Interpretation**: Staffing adequacy and resource management
- **Drivers**: Budget allocation, workforce planning, case mix

## Healthcare Context

### Quality Measurement Programs
- **CMS Hospital Compare**: Public reporting of hospital quality metrics
- **Value-Based Purchasing**: Medicare reimbursement tied to performance
- **Hospital Star Ratings**: Overall quality summary (1-5 stars)
- **Joint Commission**: Accreditation standards and quality measures

### Improvement Initiatives
- **Bundled Payments**: Financial incentives for coordinated care
- **Accountable Care Organizations**: Shared responsibility for population health
- **Lean/Six Sigma**: Process improvement methodologies
- **Electronic Health Records**: Data-driven quality monitoring

## Educational Applications

### Multivariate Analysis
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Identify main dimensions of hospital quality
- **Factor Analysis**: Understand latent quality constructs
- **Cluster Analysis**: Group hospitals by performance profiles
- **Regression Analysis**: Predict outcomes from process measures

### Healthcare Management
- **Benchmarking**: Compare hospital performance to peers
- **Quality Improvement**: Target areas for intervention
- **Resource Allocation**: Invest in high-impact quality initiatives
- **Strategic Planning**: Develop competitive advantages through quality

### Statistical Concepts
- **Correlation vs Causation**: High correlations don't prove causal relationships
- **Confounding Variables**: Case mix and patient acuity affect outcomes
- **Measurement Error**: Challenges in accurate quality assessment
- **Sample Size**: Statistical power for detecting quality differences

## Data Generation Notes

# Educational Example â€” PCA & FA comparison

This folder contains two educational scripts demonstrating PCA and Factor Analysis on the same synthetic dataset. The examples are intended for classroom use and direct method comparison.

Files

- `educational_pca.py` - PCA analysis on synthetic educational assessment data
Files

- `educational_pca.py` - Main PCA analysis script with detailed explanations and validation
- `educational_fa.py` - Factor Analysis using the same synthetic data for direct comparison
- `pca_scree.png`, `pca_biplot.png`, `fa_loadings.png`, `fa_scree.png` - figures produced by the scripts

Usage

Run either script from this folder (recommended using the virtual environment):

```bash
python educational_pca.py
python educational_fa.py
```

Notes

- These scripts mirror the previous `pca_example` files but are renamed to better reflect their educational purpose and to avoid ambiguous folder names.
- If other parts of the repository reference `pca_example`, update those references to `educational_example`.

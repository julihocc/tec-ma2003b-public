== Introduction to Multivariate Analysis

#slide(title: [Multivariate Analysis Overview])[
  - *Multivariate Analysis*: Statistical methods for analyzing multiple variables simultaneously
  - *Key Challenge*: Understanding relationships among many correlated variables
  - *Two Main Approaches*:
    - _Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_: Dimensionality reduction technique

== Principal Component Analysis

#slide(title: [Refresher: What is PCA?])[
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear method for *dimension reduction*.  - It finds orthogonal directions (principal components) that capture the largest possible variance in the data.  - PCA produces new variables (components) that are linear combinations of the original observed variables.  - Use cases: visualization, noise reduction, pre-processing before supervised learning, and exploratory data analysis.]

#slide(title: [Mathematical formulation])[
  Let $bold(x) in RR^p$ be a random vector with mean $mu$ and covariance matrix $Sigma$. After centering the data $(bold(x)-mu)$:
  - Find eigenvalues $lambda_1 >= lambda_2 >= ... >= lambda_p$ and orthonormal eigenvectors $bold(v)_1, ..., bold(v)_p$ of $Sigma$: $Sigma bold(v)_j = lambda_j bold(v)_j$.  - The $j$-th principal component is $z_j = bold(v)_j^top (bold(x)-mu)$.  - Variance explained by component $j$ is $"Var"(z_j) = lambda_j$. The proportion explained is $lambda_j / sum_(k=1)^p lambda_k$.]

#slide(title: [Computation steps (practical)])[
  + Standardize variables if they are on different scales (use correlation matrix) or center only if scales are comparable (use covariance matrix).  + Compute covariance (or correlation) matrix $S$ from the data.  + Compute eigen decomposition $S = V Lambda V^top$.  + Form principal component scores: $Z = X_c V$ (where $X_c$ is centered data and columns of $V$ are eigenvectors).  + Inspect eigenvalues, cumulative variance, and scree plot to decide how many components to keep.]

#slide(title: [Deciding how many components to retain])[
  Common heuristics and formal approaches:
  - Kaiser criterion: keep components with eigenvalue $> 1$ (applies when using correlation matrix).  - Cumulative variance: keep the smallest number of components that explain a target (e.g., 70--90%) of total variance.  - Scree plot: look for the "elbow" where additional components contribute little incremental variance.  - Parallel analysis: compare empirical eigenvalues to those obtained from random data — keep components with larger eigenvalues than random.]

#slide(title: [PCA vs Factor Analysis (reminder)])[
  - PCA: descriptive linear combinations that maximize variance; components are exact linear functions of observed variables and need not have a causal or measurement model interpretation.  - Factor Analysis: a statistical model that explicitly decomposes observed variance into common (shared) variance explained by latent factors and unique variance (errors).  - Practical rule: use PCA for dimension reduction and data compression; use Factor Analysis when your goal is to model latent constructs and separate common from unique variance.]

#slide(title: [Practical tips and pitfalls])[
  - Always check variable scales; standardize when necessary.  - PCA is sensitive to outliers — inspect data and consider robust alternatives if needed.  - Interpret components via loadings (eigenvectors) and by examining which variables contribute strongly to each component.  - Rotation is not standard in PCA (rotation reassigns variance) — if interpretability is a priority, consider Factor Analysis with rotation.  - When reporting, include: eigenvalues table, proportion of variance, cumulative variance, scree plot, and a table of loadings (component matrix).]

== Educational Assessment: Synthetic PCA Example

#slide(title: [Educational Assessment: Synthetic PCA Example])[
  This section demonstrates PCA using controlled synthetic data with known factor structure to validate the method and teach key concepts.
  - *Dataset*: Student assessment data with 6 variables (100 students)  - *Research Question*: Can PCA recover the underlying ability factors? How does it separate meaningful structure from noise?  - *Method*: Standardized PCA on synthetic data with known latent factors

== Conclusion

#slide(title: [A Word of Caution])[
  - Neither method can _prove_ a factor structure is correct  - Multiple equally valid models may exist for the same dataset  - Always combine statistical results with domain knowledge
